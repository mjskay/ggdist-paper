This is very helpful, thanks!\r\n\r\nI think my main issue with `quasirandom` / `sina` is my bias towards layouts that are a bit more intentional --- it feels like there should be a better solution to the problems they solve. Thus, I really appreciate you giving me more info on your use case, which is exactly what I need to figure out something that might (hopefully) satisfy both of us :). Plus, I don't really know how I would do automatic binning with `sina`, since the height of a bin is not constrained by its width...\r\n\r\nMy first thought from the example you gave is that if you want smaller dots, there are two things to try: (1) reduce `scale` so that the dotplot takes up less space or (2) pass an interval to `binwidth` to set a maximum bin width.\r\n\r\n(I'll give these examples using the `dev` branch, which has some improvements to dot layout)\r\n\r\nE.g. a similar plot to your `position_quasirandom` example might use `scale = 0.25` to make `geom_dots()` find a binwidth such that the dotplots take up at most `0.25` of their allotted space (I also set `linewidth = 0` to get rid of dot outlines):\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(ggdist)\r\nset.seed(1234)\r\n\r\ndat <- tibble(\r\n  f1 = rep(1:4, each = 50), \r\n  f2 = rep(1:2, length = 200),\r\n  y = rnorm(200, f1 + f2 * .25)\r\n) %>% \r\n  mutate(across(f1:f2, factor))\r\n\r\n\r\ndat %>% \r\n  ggplot() + \r\n  geom_dots(\r\n    aes(\r\n      x = f1, \r\n      y = y, \r\n      fill = f2, \r\n      side = if_else(f2==\"1\", \"left\", \"right\")\r\n    ),\r\n    scale = 0.25,\r\n    linewidth = 0\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/208572965-a990895b-7e87-47db-8af9-0573f10363d2.png)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might decide you want the bin width in the y dimension to be at most 0.1, if that is some domain-relevant resolution at which you want to be able to see dots. If you set `binwidth = c(0, 0.1)`, the automatic binwidth algorithm will find a width in that range:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndat %>% \r\n  ggplot() + \r\n  geom_dots(\r\n    aes(\r\n      x = f1, \r\n      y = y, \r\n      fill = f2, \r\n      side = if_else(f2==\"1\", \"left\", \"right\")\r\n    ),\r\n    binwidth = c(0, 0.1),\r\n    linewidth = 0\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/208573469-61c4a33b-765e-41e9-8fa8-1ddb6715e552.png)\r\n\r\nThe other thing I'm getting from your example is that maybe you want the dots to be in their exact `y` positions. There are two combinations of options in ggdist that guarantee this: `layout = \"swarm\"`, or `layout = \"weave\", overlaps = \"keep\"` (the `overlaps` option is only in the dev version). E.g.:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndat %>% \r\n  ggplot() + \r\n  geom_dots(\r\n    aes(\r\n      x = f1, \r\n      y = y, \r\n      fill = f2, \r\n      side = if_else(f2==\"1\", \"left\", \"right\")\r\n    ),\r\n    binwidth = c(0, 0.1),\r\n    linewidth = 0,\r\n    layout = \"swarm\"\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/208573989-79cd58c7-f5d1-49e1-9b9b-ae693d271df3.png)\r\n\r\nAt this point, if you find the dots too small and want them to be visually bigger while maintaining the bin width of 0.1 (and exact y positions), you could also pick some number `k > 1` and set `dotsize = k` (visual width of the dot relative to bin size) and `stackratio = 1/k` (stacking height between dots).

I'm not sure why this would ever happen, and I especially don't understand why changing one value by `3.4e-16` would cause it to happen.\r\n\r\n``` r\r\n\r\ndat |>\r\n  transform(xmin = xmin + c(0, 3.4e-16, 0, 0)) |>\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, color = color)) +\r\n  geom_interval()\r\n```\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PFN7hnB.png)\r\n\r\nHere's my session info:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\n\r\nsessionInfo()\r\n#> R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)\r\n#> Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\r\n#> Running under: macOS Monterey 12.6\r\n#> \r\n#> Matrix products: default\r\n#> LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib\r\n#> \r\n#> locale:\r\n#> [1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\r\n#> \r\n#> attached base packages:\r\n#> [1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \r\n#> \r\n#> other attached packages:\r\n#> [1] ggdist_3.2.0  ggplot2_3.3.6\r\n#> \r\n#> loaded via a namespace (and not attached):\r\n#>  [1] pillar_1.8.1         compiler_4.2.1       highr_0.9           \r\n#>  [4] R.methodsS3_1.8.2    R.utils_2.12.0       tools_4.2.1         \r\n#>  [7] digest_0.6.30        evaluate_0.17        lifecycle_1.0.3     \r\n#> [10] tibble_3.1.8         gtable_0.3.1         R.cache_0.16.0      \r\n#> [13] pkgconfig_2.0.3      rlang_1.0.6          reprex_2.0.2        \r\n#> [16] DBI_1.1.3            cli_3.4.1            rstudioapi_0.14     \r\n#> [19] yaml_2.3.5           xfun_0.33            fastmap_1.1.0       \r\n#> [22] dplyr_1.0.10         withr_2.5.0          styler_1.7.0        \r\n#> [25] stringr_1.4.1        knitr_1.40           generics_0.1.3      \r\n#> [28] fs_1.5.2             vctrs_0.5.0          tidyselect_1.2.0    \r\n#> [31] grid_4.2.1           glue_1.6.2           R6_2.5.1            \r\n#> [34] fansi_1.0.3          distributional_0.3.1 rmarkdown_2.17      \r\n#> [37] farver_2.1.1         purrr_0.3.5          magrittr_2.0.3      \r\n#> [40] scales_1.2.1         htmltools_0.5.3      assertthat_0.2.1    \r\n#> [43] colorspace_2.0-3     labeling_0.4.2       utf8_1.2.2          \r\n#> [46] stringi_1.7.8        munsell_0.5.0        R.oo_1.25.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n<sup>Created on 2022-10-27 with [reprex v2.0.2](https://reprex.tidyverse.org)</sup>\r\n\r\n","closed":true,"closedAt":"2023-01-30T02:14:12Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEBBtO85T6qUQ","author":{"login":"mjskay"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Yeah, this is intended behavior --- geom_interval reorders intervals so that larger ones are towards the back.

The first one is simpler: if you want the stacks running horizontally but not overlapping, I would pick the side based on `Var1`; something like this:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nggplot(Data4Plot, aes(x = Var1, colour = Var2, y = prob))+\r\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymax = asymp.UCL, ymin = asymp.LCL),\r\n                position = position_dodge(0.3),width = 0.2) +\r\n  geom_point(size = 1.5,position = position_dodge(0.3))+\r\n  geom_dots(data = DF,layout = \"bin\",\r\n            aes(y = Y,\r\n                side = ifelse(Var2 == \"C\", \"left\", \"right\"),\r\n                color = Var2,\r\n                x = Var1),\r\n            shape = 19,\r\n            scale = 0.5\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/194722318-ec0022dc-2389-4380-9ead-c89b2aa59598.png)\r\n\r\nIf you want them vertical, it's a bit trickier. You have to override the orientation detection and change the geom orientation to `\"horizontal\"` (horizontal here meaning the direction of the base of the dots, thus \"horizontal\" instead of \"vertical\"). Unfortunately you can't use `position_dodge` here because it will dodge in the opposite direction of what you want, so we have to manually calculate the dodge by adjusting the `x` aesthetic mapping.

Currently, if you use .width then ggdist automatically scales each interval to a different line thickness (plots the 90% CI thicker than the 95% CI, etc).  But if you set interval_size this goes away -- each interval in .width is plotted at the same thickness, so the longest one obscures the others.  Is it possible to make it so that interval_size just sets the starting point for the automatic adjustments done for each value in .width?\r\n\r\nHere's what I've been using to plot 90 and 95% CIs together with .width\r\n\r\n```\r\n  myplot <- myplot + ggdist::stat_dist_halfeye(\r\n    data = gdata,\r\n    orientation = 'vertical',\r\n    ggplot2::aes(\r\n      x = x_value,\r\n      y = y_value,\r\n      dist = distributional::dist_student_t(\r\n        df = df,\r\n        mu = y_value,\r\n        sigma = SE\r\n      )\r\n    ),\r\n  .width = c(0.9,0.95),\r\n  normalize = 'groups'\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I add interval_size both 90% and 95% CIs take on the value, so the 90% CI is masked:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  myplot <- myplot + ggdist::stat_dist_halfeye(\r\n    data = gdata,\r\n    orientation = 'vertical',\r\n    ggplot2::aes(\r\n      x = x_value,\r\n      y = y_value,\r\n      dist = distributional::dist_student_t(\r\n        df = df,\r\n        mu = y_value,\r\n        sigma = SE\r\n      )\r\n    ),\r\n  .width = c(0.9,0.95),\r\n  invterval_size = 3,\r\n  normalize = 'groups'\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I'm working around this by manually adding in the 90% CI... but figured I'd ask in case I'd missed something or if it might be something that could be tweaked in future releases.  \r\n\r\nAs usual, thanks -- this package is amazing.

The problem is that by setting interval_size outside of `aes()`, you are setting it to a constant value for both intervals. Instead, you need to adjust the range of sizes that are used for the intervals.

Currently stat_histinterval won't work here because it defaults to densities for analytical distributions unless they are determined to be discrete. Could adjust so that it can generate histograms as needed, or at least for discrete/continuous mixtures. Picking the binwidth will be a bit of an issue possibly best left to users, as the spike can be made arbitrarily tall with an arbitrarily small binwidth...\r\n2. Plotting the continuous and discrete portions of the distribution separately. This is probably a more accurate depiction of the distribution, but will require some finagling. Not sure the best way --- maybe a helper function to get the discrete and continuous portions of a mixture and allow those to be plotted on their own.\r\n\r\nProbably either solution is useful in some cases, so a good \"meta\" solution might be to implement both of the above and when faced with discrete/continuous mixtures might be to raise a warning or error and point folks in the direction of either solution.","createdAt":"2022-08-23T03:42:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/146#issuecomment-1223494884","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOEBBtO85JBRMk","author":{"login":"alexdeng"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Yeah. i was thinking for mixture of pointmass with continuous distribution, maybe we need to sample from it first.

You can override aesthetics for a specific legend using the `override.aes` argument to `guide_legend()`. In your case, this means adding something like:\r\n\r\n`guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(interval_size = NA))`\r\n\r\nto the call to your fill scale function (in this case `scale_fill_manual()`) so that the size of the interval is set to `NA` for the legend and the black line is not drawn.\r\n\r\nRe: the title of \"level\", this is just an automatic `color` scale, so you can change it the same way you change other scale titles, e.g. by passing `color = \"Level\"` to the `labs()` function.\r\n\r\nAn example with both changes:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndata.frame(x = rnorm(1000), var = c(\"a\",\"b\")) %>% \r\n  ggplot(aes(x, var, fill = stat(abs(x) < 1.5))) + \r\n  stat_halfeye(scale = 0.5) +\r\n  stat_interval(position = position_nudge(y = -0.2), size = 2)+\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray80\", \"skyblue\"), guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(interval_size = NA))) +\r\n  scale_color_brewer() +\r\n  labs(\r\n    fill = \"Rope\",\r\n    color = \"Level\"\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/184558169-96232b1f-d796-46d5-9fcd-848de6424de4.png)\r\n","createdAt":"2022-08-14T23:07:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/145#issuecomment-1214467395","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2022-08-14T04:55:45Z","id":"I_kwDOEBBtO85PwlDn","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":145,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Legend customization ","updatedAt":"2022-08-14T23:07:43Z","url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/145"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDU0MDA=","is_bot":false,"login":"avehtari","name":"Aki Vehtari"},"body":"The dot plot is not symmetric, and for both x or -x as input the rightmost column of dots is too short.

Some comparisons here: https://github.com/mjskay/interval-estimators/blob/main/interval-estimators.md (source Rmd in same repo).\r\n\r\nI can see three broad classes worth investigating:\r\n- equi-tailed intervals, for which the usual estimator is the quantile interval (which could come in several forms; e.g. `quantile()` has 9 different quantile estimators). `ggdist::qi()` and `bayestestR::eti()` are examples\r\n- shortest intervals, for which there is the empirical shortest interval based on quantiles (which could come in as many forms as the equi-tailed intervals); I believe `ggdist::hdci()` and `bayestestR::hdi()` are examples; then there is the \"Spin\" algorithm implemented as `bayestestR::spi()`; I also added a rough implementation of a variant that can use any of the 9 different quantile estimators in `quantile()` to the above document (see the function `quantile_shortest_interval()`.\r\n- highest-density intervals, which unlike the other two may consist of multiple intervals. Implementations include `ggdist::hdi()` / `HDInterval::hdi(density(x))`, `hdrcde::hdr()`, and `distributional::hdr()`\r\n\r\nI have been looking at a few quantities of interest:\r\n- root mean squared error of the lower and upper ends of the intervals\r\n- mean percentage overlap of the estimated interval with the true interval\r\n- coverage (probability mass of the true distribution contained by the interval)\r\n- variance (sd) of the endpoints of the intervals\r\n\r\nAlso to look at: bias. \r\n\r\nOne intriguing thing so far is that SPI doesn't perform much differently on these metrics compared to the empirical shortest interval implementations (with the exception of having coverage closer to nominal), which is surprising as the SPI paper says SPI should have lower error than HDCI. I'm not sure if that's an implementation issue or what.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I've found so far is that amongst HDI algorithms, `distributional::hdr()` is looking the best. In particular it has lower variance than others, performing consistently down near quantile intervals in terms of variance. All the other algorithms for HDIs or HDCIs tend to have higher variance than quantile intervals, which is why I have tended to recommend against HDIs and HDCIs. But changing the underlying implementation of HDIs to the one in distributional might reduce that concern for cases when HDIs are desired (so long as multiple intervals are acceptable). \r\n\r\nSee e.g. this chart: these are 80% ribbons; there are 100 groups along the x axis, each a sample of size 10,000 from N(0,1). As far as I'm concerned qi and (barely) hdr are the only two with acceptable variance here. The other three are different algorithms for shortest intervals. Given that 10,000 tends to be the upper end of effective sample sizes people tend to generate from MCMC, unless there's a better algorithm out there for shortest intervals we aren't aware of, I'm not sure I'd recommend using them...\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/177066267-64dbd266-d9b5-43db-99dd-d6933e242c02.png)\r\n","createdAt":"2022-07-04T01:28:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/136#issuecomment-1173238705","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOEBBtO85GBL4r","author":{"login":"mattansb"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I find it very surprising that even with 500 samples the methods don't differ that much (and that SPI seems to have relatively larger variance, if ever so slightly...).\r\n\r\nWould it be interesting to compare these methods with [`ggdist::curve_interval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/curve_interval.html) in the context of interval-bands?

Unfortunately `position = \"dodge\"` won't either, as it is designed for dodging perpendicular to the orientation of the geometry rather than applying as offset along the same axis.\r\n\r\nIn your case, with discrete data, you could hack together a rough version of what you want by manually adding values to the x variable conditional on the group. This will be brittle in that it will be sensitive to the size and aspect ratio of the chart (which influences the algorithm that determines the size of the dots), but if you have fixed data and chart parameters it shouldn't be too hard to pick a reasonable offset. For example, something like this:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nggplot() +\r\n  geom_dots(\r\n    data = dat,\r\n    aes(\r\n      x = year + 0.1 * (grp == \"A\"),\r\n      y = pass,\r\n      side = ifelse(pass == 0, \"top\", \"bottom\"),\r\n      color = grp\r\n    ),\r\n    position = \"identity\", # dodge?!\r\n    orientation = \"horizontal\",\r\n    shape = 19,\r\n    scale = 0.1\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/149206767-1551a53a-433a-4ba7-82e7-0f53d1b91e07.png)\r\n\r\nSadly not as elegant as I'd like, but hopefully gets the job done?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2022-01-12T19:16:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"ROCKET","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/122#issuecomment-1011370787","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOEBBtO848UNma","author":{"login":"SchmidtPaul"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Good enough, thanks a lot!","createdAt":"2022-01-13T09:02:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/122#issuecomment-1011931546","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-01-12T12:19:40Z","id":"I_kwDOEBBtO85BlN7B","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":122,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Dot plot with `aes(color = )` and `position_dodge()`?","updatedAt":"2022-01-13T09:02:12Z","url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/122"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDUwMTk=","is_bot":false,"login":"mjskay","name":"Matthew Kay"},"body":"Should be possible after:\r\n\r\n- [x] #116\r\n- [ ] #87 ","closed":true,"closedAt":"2022-01-14T02:19:54Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-12-29T23:13:35Z","id":"I_kwDOEBBtO85BBCQp","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":121,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Get coverage to 100%","updatedAt":"2022-01-14T02:19:54Z","url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/121"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDUwMTk=","is_bot":false,"login":"mjskay","name":"Matthew Kay"},"body":"It really is a whole subfamily of slabinterval unto itself, so it's worth expanding out the docs on it (then we can also include more recent / complex examples of dotplots, such as those from [this blog post](https://blog.mjskay.com/2021/07/15/tidybayes-ggdist-3-0/))","closed":true,"closedAt":"2022-01-15T22:37:49Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-12-15T19:38:33Z","id":"I_kwDOEBBtO85AdXq8","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTExMzQ5MjM1","name":"documentation","description":"Improvements or additions to documentation","color":"0075ca"}],"milestone":{"number":4,"title":"Next release ","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":120,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Make a vignette for dotsinterval","updatedAt":"2022-01-15T22:37:49Z","url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/120"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDUwMTk=","is_bot":false,"login":"mjskay","name":"Matthew Kay"},"body":"For conditional examples (e.g. ones depending on suggested packages), switch to using `@examplesIf`","closed":true,"closedAt":"2021-12-30T23:38:20Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-12-15T02:21:25Z","id":"I_kwDOEBBtO85AZvQl","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTExMzQ5MjM1","name":"documentation","description":"Improvements or additions to documentation","color":"0075ca"}],"milestone":null,"number":119,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Use new @examplesIf tag in roxygen examples","updatedAt":"2021-12-30T23:38:20Z","url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/119"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDUwMTk=","is_bot":false,"login":"mjskay","name":"Matthew Kay"},"body":"Pulling this out as its own issue (original comment from @steveharoz below)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to do things like specify things like `center`, `binwidth`, etc (similar to things that `geom_histogram()` supports) instead of `breaks`.

I guess another approach would be to first plot the group distributions with a constant nudge and then plot the difference without a nudge... but open to any suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's example code:\r\n\r\n`# Libraries\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(ggdist)\r\nlibrary(distributional)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Population params for desired data\r\npopulation <- data.frame(\r\n  condition = c(\"Group1\", \"Group2\"),\r\n  mu = c(100, 115),\r\n  sigma = c(15, 15),\r\n  n = c(50, 45)\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Simulate raw data and calculate summary data\r\nraw_data <- NULL\r\nsummary_data <- NULL\r\n\r\nfor (i in 1:nrow(population)) {\r\n  this_condition <- data.frame(\r\n    condition = rep(population[i, \"condition\"], times = population[i, \"n\"]),\r\n    outcome = rnorm(\r\n      n = population[i, \"n\"], \r\n      mean = population[i, \"mu\"],\r\n      sd = population[i, \"sigma\"]\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  summary_data <- rbind(\r\n    summary_data,\r\n    data.frame(\r\n      condition = c(population[i, \"condition\"]),\r\n      mean = mean(this_condition$outcome),\r\n      sd = sd(this_condition$outcome),\r\n      se = sd(this_condition$outcome) / sqrt(nrow(this_condition)),\r\n      n = nrow(this_condition),\r\n      df = nrow(this_condition) - 1\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  raw_data <- rbind(\r\n    raw_data,\r\n    this_condition\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n# Difference between groups\r\ndiff_m <- summary_data[1, \"mean\"] - summary_data[2, \"mean\"]\r\ndiff_df <- sum(summary_data$df)\r\ndiff_se <- sqrt(sum(summary_data$sd^2 / summary_data$n))\r\n\r\nsummary_data[3, c(\"mean\", \"se\", \"df\")] <- c(\r\n  diff_m,\r\n  diff_se,\r\n  diff_df\r\n)\r\nsummary_data[3, \"condition\"] <- \"Difference\"\r\n\r\nsummary_data$nudge <- c(0.3, 0.3, 0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Fix condition factor to ensure difference is plotted last\r\nsummary_data$condition <- factor(\r\n  summary_data$condition, \r\n  levels = summary_data$condition\r\n)\r\nraw_data$condition <- factor(\r\n  raw_data$condition,\r\n  levels = summary_data$condition\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Now the plot\r\nmyplot <- ggplot2::ggplot(data = summary_data)\r\n\r\nmyplot <- myplot + ggdist::stat_dist_halfeye(\r\n  data = summary_data,\r\n  ggplot2::aes(\r\n    x = condition, \r\n    y = mean,\r\n    dist = distributional::dist_student_t(\r\n      df = df, \r\n      mu = mean, \r\n      sigma = se\r\n    )\r\n  ),\r\n  scale = 0.33,\r\n  position = position_nudge(x = summary_data$nudge)\r\n)\r\n\r\nmyplot <- myplot + ggplot2::geom_point(\r\n  data = raw_data,\r\n  aes(\r\n    x = condition,\r\n    y = outcome\r\n  ),\r\n  position = position_jitter(width = 0.2)\r\n)\r\n\r\nmyplot\r\n`","closed":true,"closedAt":"2021-09-11T13:44:59Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEBBtO842nn67","author":{"login":"mjskay"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Yeah, the problem is that `position_nudge` gets applied after the `stat`s are. What's happening internally is that `stat_dist_halfeye()` is producing a data frame that contains density values and the points and intervals and this is being passed to `position_nudge()` (and then eventually to the underlying geometry).\r\n\r\nThis data frame will be (by default) 501 x number of groups + 2 x number of groups in length --- 501 values from each density plus one row per interval per group. What's happening is that your vector of 3 values is being recycled to cover those (501 + 2) * 3 = 1509 rows, but not in a way that lines up with the rows corresponding to each group. Instead, if you give a vector of `c(0.3, 0.3, 0)`, the values are interleaved, so you would end up with 2/3s of the density values for each group having a nudge of `0.3` and 1/3 having a nudge of `0`, hence the apparent duplication.\r\n\r\nOne (**bad and not recommended**) solution would be to give a nudge vector of length 1509:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nmyplot <- ggplot2::ggplot(data = summary_data)\r\n\r\nmyplot <- myplot + ggdist::stat_dist_halfeye(\r\n    data = summary_data,\r\n    ggplot2::aes(\r\n        x = condition,\r\n        y = mean,\r\n        dist = distributional::dist_student_t(\r\n            df = df,\r\n            mu = mean,\r\n            sigma = se\r\n        )\r\n    ),\r\n    scale = 0.33,\r\n    position = position_nudge(x = c(rep(summary_data$nudge, each = 501), rep(summary_data$nudge, each = 2)))\r\n)\r\n\r\nmyplot <- myplot + ggplot2::geom_point(\r\n    data = raw_data,\r\n    aes(\r\n        x = condition,\r\n        y = outcome\r\n    ),\r\n    position = position_jitter(width = 0.2)\r\n)\r\n\r\nmyplot\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/132744830-3c119336-5a01-4414-bbdc-483558892582.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a bad solution because it relies on the order of rows in the internal dataframe not changing in future implementations of ggdist, which I cannot guarantee. So, while it works, I would not recommend it.\r\n\r\nSome alternatives: one would be to use two different geoms to specify the nudges seperately.

This ensures that with a justification of `0` the bottom edge of the slab touches the interval and with a justification of `1` the top edge touches no matter the value of `scale`.

Why not only allow `x=<dist>` and `y=<dist>`, and require users to know scales better? It has caused some user friction with `tsibble::scale_x_year***()` scales, but I think that is more of a documentation issue. Would you then transform the distribution axis with `scale_x_distribution(trans = ???)`?\r\n(3) Another good option.

To transform the distribution axis, would you use scale_x_continuous() or scale_xdist_continuous()?\r\n\r\n`scale_x_continuous()` (or `scale_x_discrete()` for a discrete distribution). This is basically how it works now with the `dist` aesthetic (which I agree is a little error-prone in current usage). Personally I think this works better, as distributions are often combined with other things on the same scale that are not distributions, so we aren't really setting up a scale for distributions per se, but whatever the underlying data type is (this brings up another wrinkle with putting distributions on x/y using `scale_x_dist()`: the `limits()` function doesn't really work with it (thus `xlim`/`ylim` don't really work) because the limits aren't expressed as distributional objects, but as objects of the underlying data type (numeric or integer or what have you).\r\n\r\nSo, I am kind of coming to the conclusion that unlike things like dates/times, which are legitimately other data types from a scale perspective, distributions don't really match that paradigm. Especially if you add support for other data types in `dist_sample()`: then we'd want dist scales for any other arbitrary data type. So maybe I'll just stick with `xdist` and `ydist` for now.\r\n\r\nSo I'm now leaning away from (2).\r\n\r\nIn the absence of option (2), the argument for option (1) is twofold: (A) that it allows x/y axis titles to be generated automatically from variable names and (B) that errors often happen when people accidentally map distributions to `x` or `y` instead of `dist`. Under option (3) I think (B) could be solved with the introduction of `xdist` / `ydist` and an error message if someone maps a distribution to `x` or `y` that tells them to map it to `xdist` or `ydist`. So the only question remaining is if (A) matters.","createdAt":"2021-11-19T05:06:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/83#issuecomment-973756034","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOEBBtO846Dtyb","author":{"login":"bwiernik"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Re (A), I think the automatic axis titles are so rarely finalized that it's a minor concern.

At first I thought there was no easy solution. The problem is that when `stat`s are computed, variables from the original data are mapped onto aesthetic variables (like x, y, color, etc) and the `stat` is computed on those, then the result of that computation creates another data frame which is passed onto the geom. Expressions like `fill = stat(...)` act on that final data frame, and hence cannot directly access any columns of the original data frame (you can read more about this stuff [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_eval.html)).\r\n\r\n**However,** it turns out (I just discovered) you can get around this in some cases (depending on the `stat`) by assigning variables from your input data to fake aesthetics. In most ggdist `stat`s (and in particular the `stat_dist_` ones) these fake aesthetics should survive the transformation pipeline and be passed on to the geom.\r\n\r\nSo one solution here is to assign your lower/upper bounds to some fake aesthetics (say `l` and `u`) and then use those in your `stat(...)` calculation:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(ggdist)\r\nlibrary(distributional)\r\n\r\nmy_data <- data.frame(\r\n  outcome_variable = c(\"SWB\", \"SWB\", \"Self_Esteem\", \"Self_Esteem\"),\r\n  effect_size_label = c(\"Intervention1 - Control\", \"Intervention2 - Control\",\r\n                         \"Intervention1 - Control\", \"Intervention2 - Control\"),\r\n  effect_size = c(0, 1, 1.5, 0.2),\r\n  se = c(0.50, 0.50, 1, 1),\r\n  df = c(50, 50, 50, 50)\r\n)\r\n\r\nrope <- 0.3\r\n\r\nmy_data$rope_upper <- my_data$se * rope\r\nmy_data$rope_lower <- -my_data$rope_upper\r\n\r\nmy_plot <- ggplot2::ggplot(\r\n  data = my_data,\r\n  ggplot2::aes(\r\n    x = effect_size,\r\n    y = effect_size_label\r\n  )\r\n)  + ggplot2::facet_grid(cols = ggplot2::vars(outcome_variable))\r\n\r\nmy_plot <- my_plot + ggdist::stat_dist_halfeye(\r\n  ggplot2::aes(\r\n    dist = distributional::dist_student_t(\r\n      df = df,\r\n      mu = effect_size,\r\n      sigma = se\r\n    ),\r\n    # assign bounds to fake aesthetics (`l` and `u`) so that they are available\r\n    # after the stat has been calculated (for use in the `fill` expression)\r\n    l = rope_lower,\r\n    u = rope_upper,\r\n    fill = stat(x > l & x < u)\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n\r\nmy_plot\r\n```\r\n```\r\n## Warning message:\r\n## Ignoring unknown aesthetics: l, u \r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/122614100-9ff9b980-d04b-11eb-8ba1-b6e30e3d7ebc.png)\r\n\r\nWhile it does warn about unknown aesthetics I don't think this should be a problem in this case.

This doesn't make a big difference because I have to run a (modified) Wilkinson binning algorithm to determine max bin height anyway, so really I'm just using number of bins as a discretization of bin width in the search (in fact the search itself is a bastardized binary search because it doesn't require number of bins to be an integer).

The provided scale works with the following aesthetics: point_colour\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```r\r\nError (test.stat_dist_slabinterval.R:68:3): stat fill aesthetic on halfeye works\r\nError: The `type` argument of `scale_colour_discrete()` must return a continuous scale for the colour aesthetic. The provided scale works with the following aesthetics: slab_colour\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe hope to release the next version next week but this issue flew under my radar - let me know if it is possible to prepare a fix by then\r\n\r\nbest\r\nThomas","closed":true,"closedAt":"2021-06-10T05:29:19Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NzI4MjMwMA==","author":{"login":"mjskay"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Sure, I'll take a look today or tomorrow and see if I can fix it quick","createdAt":"2021-06-09T00:29:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/72#issuecomment-857282300","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1ODIzODQ3OA==","author":{"login":"mjskay"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"@thomasp85 thanks for all the help and for putting in the work to check all the zillions of ggplot dependencies, it is really appreciated :)\r\n\r\nI think I've got this fixed, I'll submit to cran in the next day or two and post a followup here when it's accepted.\r\n","createdAt":"2021-06-10T02:50:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/72#issuecomment-858238478","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1ODY0Nzk2Mw==","author":{"login":"mjskay"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Thanks again Thomas, the fixed version of ggdist is now on CRAN.","createdAt":"2021-06-10T14:00:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/72#issuecomment-858647963","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2021-06-08T09:17:27Z","id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MTQ2NTk5NDU=","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":72,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Issues with the next version of ggplot2","updatedAt":"2021-06-10T14:00:06Z","url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/72"},{"assignees":[],"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjA4MDg3","is_bot":false,"login":"arthur-albuquerque","name":""},"body":"Similar to the section \"Highlighting and other combinations\" in https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/articles/slabinterval.html, I want to use 2 different colours in distributions using stat_halfeye based on a cutoff. \r\n\r\nHowever, instead of using the same combination of colours in parallel distributions (just like the reference above), I would like to use different combinations.

Now we can apply a custom color scale to get the desired output:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = stat(interaction(y, x < 0)))) +\r\n  stat_halfeye() +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray75\", \"gray75\", \"skyblue\", \"firebrick\")) \r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/120093695-7ea74c80-c0e1-11eb-8d2c-6779d5c73595.png)\r\n\r\nThis works, but it kind of brittle --- having to set the values manually this way won't work well if you add more variables to the combinations of levels.\r\n\r\n## Second method: use fill_ramp\r\n\r\nThe other option would be to use `fill_ramp`. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = y, fill_ramp = stat(x < 0))) +\r\n  stat_halfeye()\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/120093609-0ccf0300-c0e1-11eb-898b-afc828930ba0.png)\r\n\r\nThe default settings for the `fill_ramp` scale on discrete variables ramps to 80% white. But we can ramp to `\"gray85\"` instead. We can also set your custom colors on the fill scale:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = y, fill_ramp = stat(x < 0))) +\r\n  stat_halfeye() +\r\n  scale_fill_ramp_discrete(from = \"gray85\", range = c(0,1)) +\r\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"skyblue\", \"firebrick\"))\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/120093713-8cf56880-c0e1-11eb-8087-544cff54a85e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes that help?","createdAt":"2021-05-30T05:54:59Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/71#issuecomment-850946577","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MTA0MzUyMA==","author":{"login":"arthur-albuquerque"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Fantastic. ggdist is such a great package.

However, according to the typical ggplot semantics for fill and alpha aesthetics as I understand them, it is the correct behavior. What you see is due to two things interacting with each other:\r\n\r\n1. The `\"transparent\"` color is defined as white with 0 alpha:\r\n\r\n    ```r\r\n    col2rgb(\"transparent\", alpha = TRUE)\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n          [,1]\r\n    red    255\r\n    green  255\r\n    blue   255\r\n    alpha    0\r\n    ```\r\n2. The alpha aesthetic is essentially an \"override\" for the alpha channel of the fill aesthetic. When the alpha aesthetic is not set / is `NA`, the alpha channel is left alone, otherwise the alpha channel is simply replaced with whatever value the alpha aesthetic has.\r\n\r\nThese behaviors are the same in base ggplot geoms, e.g. with `geom_rect()`:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\ndata.frame(x = 1:4) %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = 1, width = 3, height = 3)) +\r\n  geom_tile(fill = \"transparent\", alpha = 0.5) +\r\n  theme_grey()\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6345019/116962608-0d07ea00-ac6c-11eb-86c5-95e668e471ca.png)\r\n\r\nThus, I would think of the semantics of `\"transparent\"` as something like \"transparent white\" and not \"no fill\". The value to set for \"no fill\" is, as in your second example, `NA`. For this reason I would pretty much always use `NA` in preference to `\"transparent\"`.\r\n\r\nAnyway I totally agree that this is not intuitive, it took me awhile to figure out what was supposed to happen in cases like this (actually to solve a previous bug you reported about alpha not working correctly :) )\r\n","createdAt":"2021-05-04T05:06:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/68#issuecomment-831685110","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTk1MTEzOQ==","author":{"login":"bwiernik"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah, I was misremembering what the behavior of base geoms was.

Some things have conspired to create problems: the mode estimator for a continuous variable we are using uses a kernel density estimator, which currently does not cut off at the bounds of the data (even though it should). That's an easy fix that will prevent negative numbers in this case.\r\n\r\nThat said, for your data it still doesn't give a great estimate of the mode. The reason is because for the density estimator we still need to pick a grid size, and given the range of your data, the default grid size is not good (in fact you don't get a good estimate of the mode on your data until the grid size is on the order of 30,000 points, which is a little ridiculous). I'm not inclined to change those defaults unless someone who knows a lot about mode estimation comes along and suggests a good general-purpose mode estimator. The [modeest](https://cran.r-project.org/package=modeest) package has a bunch but seemingly little guidance on their selection. My guess is their applicability depends on your data, which makes it hard to pick a generic one.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n- I've updated `Mode()` to at least use trimmed densities, which should solve the problem of getting numbers outside the range of the data. You will have to install the latest version from github to use it: `devtools::install_github(\"mjskay/ggdist\")`. However the mode estimate in your case is still not great:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(ggdist)\r\n\r\nx = c(8104.6708071, 2.1980919, 0.7569663, 6.2002883, 3.2318454, 2.5476119, 1.3982123, 2.9978539, 1.3471747, 2.2059935)\r\n\r\nMode(x)\r\n## [1] 0.7569663\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- I'd recommend looking at mode estimators in {modeest} to see if some of those serve your needs better. If you are using `mode_hdi()` currently you can define your own `point_interval` function that uses a different mode estimator by doing something like this:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(ggdist)\r\nlibrary(modeest)\r\n\r\nx = c(8104.6708071, 2.1980919, 0.7569663, 6.2002883, 3.2318454, 2.5476119, 1.3982123, 2.9978539, 1.3471747, 2.2059935)\r\n\r\n# define a point_interval function using the hsm (half sample mode) estimator from modeest\r\nhsm_hdi = function(...) point_interval(..., .point = hsm, .interval = hdi)\r\n\r\nhsm_hdi(x, .width = 0.66)\r\n##          y     ymin     ymax .width .point .interval\r\n## 1 2.202043 1.347175 3.231845   0.66    hsm       hdi\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that helps!","createdAt":"2021-02-16T02:44:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/57#issuecomment-779545352","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTY0OTIzMQ==","author":{"login":"Famondir"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot.

I like the idea of combining densities with dotplots and dearly wish it was easier... Unfortunately at the moment there's no easy fix. The problem is the automatic bin adjustment on the dotplots needs to be calculated at display time (because it depends on chart size), which can only be done by making the dotplots into their own grob objects (the underlying geometry objects used by {grid}). To coordinate across the dotplots and the densities they would *probably* all need to be in the same grob object (that, or I'd have to come up with some bizarre hack to coordinate across multiple grobs in a way {grid} is not really designed to do). That would likely require them all to be created in the same geom, or I'd have to add a way to coordinate across geoms as well. So any solution would require non-trivial re-architecting of the internal code and careful thought about what the API should look like. I'm not against this in principle (in fact I've already done this kind of thing several times in tidybayes) but it's definitely not a quick fix, and I'm not even 100% sure it's possible. I'm also not sure exactly what the right relationship between the dotplot scaling and density scaling should be. Happy to take suggestions.\r\n\r\nSo this isn't a \"no\", because it is a use case I would love to support! It just is not likely to be anytime soon 🙂.\r\n\r\nSidebar: in your example since you only have a few samples per group I would use regular old dotplots, not quantile dotplots.

If the segments (or bar charts) are used to plot density values associated with integers - as is the case in my plot - I think there might be a \"hacky\" way to detect that by paying attention to the warnings thrown by R.  \r\n\r\nCompare this:\r\n\r\n`dpois(c(0,1,2,3), lambda = 2)`\r\n\r\n> dpois(c(0,1,2,3), lambda = 2)\r\n[1] 0.1353353 0.2706706 0.2706706 0.1804470\r\n\r\nwith this:\r\n\r\n`dpois(c(0,1.2,2.3,3.4), lambda = 2)`\r\n\r\n> dpois(c(0,1.2,2.3,3.4), lambda = 2)\r\n[1] 0.1353353 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\nWarning messages:\r\n1: In dpois(c(0, 1.2, 2.3, 3.4), lambda = 2) : non-integer x = 1.200000\r\n2: In dpois(c(0, 1.2, 2.3, 3.4), lambda = 2) : non-integer x = 2.300000\r\n3: In dpois(c(0, 1.2, 2.3, 3.4), lambda = 2) : non-integer x = 3.400000\r\n\r\nSo, behind the scenes, you could feed a non-integer value x to the dpois() (or some other discrete density) function as part of the test to see if it's a discrete density, collect the warning produced by R and then search in that (vector of) warning(s) for the phrase _non-integer x_.  If you find that phrase (presuming there is a warning to begin with), you can declare the density as being discrete.  \r\n\r\nTo collect warnings after calling dpois(), you can try something like this (inspired by the thread https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3903157/how-can-i-check-whether-a-function-call-results-in-a-warning):\r\n \r\n    library(purrr)\r\n\r\n    ##create a version of dpois() which will return not just results, but also warnings\r\n    qdpois <- quietly(dpois) \r\n\r\n    ##apply the version of dpois which will return the results and warnings\r\n    dens <- qdpois(c(0,1.2,2.3,3.4), lambda = 2)\r\n\r\n    ##access the results\r\n    dens$result\r\n\r\n    ##access the warnings \r\n    dens$warnings\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat comes out from the above code will be something like this: \r\n\r\n    > dens\r\n    $result\r\n    [1] 0.1353353 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\r\n\r\n    $output\r\n    [1] \"\"\r\n\r\n    $warnings\r\n    [1] \"non-integer x = 1.200000\" \"non-integer x = 2.300000\" \"non-integer x = 3.400000\"\r\n\r\n    $messages\r\n    character(0)\r\n\r\nThen you can pull dens$warnings and check if it has non-zero length first.  If it does have non-zero length, check if any of the warnings include the phrase  \"non-integer x\" (or even just \"non-integer\").  If yes, declare dpois to be a discrete distribution. \r\n\r\nThis presumes that R throws such a warning any time you try to compute a discrete density for a non-integer value (not sure that is the case - you would need to check this).\r\n  \r\nAnother way to verify you are dealing with a discrete distribution would be to check whether the density distribution name (e.g., dpois) falls among a comprehensive list of all discrete density distributions.  \r\n\r\nThe third way to verify this is to place the onus on the user to declare the distribution type.  For instance, add a parameter like \"type\" or \"distribution_type\" to your function and ask the user to set it to \"discrete\" or \"continuous\".  Or add a parameter called \"discrete\" and ask the user to set it to TRUE (for discrete densities) or FALSE (for continuous densities), etc.\r\n\r\nFun programming problem! 😊\r\n","createdAt":"2021-04-21T17:38:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/issues/19#issuecomment-824238257","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDQ5MjE3NQ==","author":{"login":"mjskay"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I think of the various options, using `is.integer(rdist(1, ...))` for whatever `dist` seems the most reliable to me, as it would be less brittle than parsing error messages. \r\n\r\nMaintaining a list of distributions is an interesting suggestion; if/when {distributional} gets support for a function that returns whether its distributions are discrete that will be an essentially similar solution.

On the one hand there might be some benefits to this approach (like allowing removal of redundant points). On the other hand it would require re-writing a bunch of stuff, and even then I'm not even sure it would completely work (e.g. in cases where someone tries to map aesthetics across different intervals within the same estimate, as one tends to do with colors in stat_interval).

This controls how many bins are drawn, but as far as I understand, those do not readily correspond to enclosed probability masses.

So in order to do the above, it would be necessary to first call, for example, `MASS::kde2d()` manually (for each group), then call `stat_contour()`, and pass the `breaks` argument, which seems inconvenient.
